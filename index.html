    FIREARMS AND DEATHS

        This post was born out of frustration. There have been 24 school shootings so far in 2015. Combined they left 21 dead and 38 injured. That's 21 more deaths and 38 more injuries than there needed to be. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I wanted to know if there was a solution. Something that both sides to the debate on guns in America could agree upon. And I was inspired by <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/" target="_blank">explorable explanations</a> - a way of visualizing and interacting with data that can help make both complex situations and abstract ideas more concrete.

        So this post is my first attempt at doing just that. I take a loaded and complex topic and try to make at least a little sense of it through the lens of one proposed solution. In the end, this turned out to not be about a solution to school shootings, at least not directly. But it <em>is</em> about decreasing the number of needless deaths due to firearms. And maybe that can be a first step to a healthier and safer gun culture in the US.

        Because the interactive parts for this will take a little bit of time to create, I'll be publishing updates to this post in 3 parts.

      PART 1: THE PROBLEM
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">

        Guns are weapons that can and do kill people. There were 464,033 deaths due to firearms from 1999-2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd initially thought this number would largely be attributed to gun violence, like the kind I see when I turn to the news on TV. Instead, I found that suicides accounted for 6 out of 10 firearm deaths in 2013. 60%! And that rate has remained fairly consistent for at least the past two decades. In addition to that, again between 1999 and 2013, nearly 10,000 people in the US died from <em>unintentional</em> shootings. Of that group, 2,260 tragically were young people between the ages of 0 and 19.
      </p>

        Seeing that "0" in the age range is particularly heart-wrenching as a new parent. And there were more numbers, lots of numbers, that came from reading reports and looking through data - <a href="http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/dataRestriction_inj.html" target="_blank">this little web app</a> from the CDC was particularly helpful. While wading through all this, it's worth remembering that these numbers are more than just a data point on a chart. These numbers are people. And even if that number is as low as 1, that "1" still represents a worth that's immeasurable.

        Prevention of suicides and unintentional deaths feels like an area that's less contentious than say... gun ownership. Even if some potential solutions are gun-related, I feel like people can more universally agree that prevention of these deaths is a good thing to strive for. So maybe this is one place we can start to draw up strategies and save lives.
